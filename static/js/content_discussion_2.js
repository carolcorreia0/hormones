At the moment, 68,3% of the women are taking non-hormonal contraceptives. We don’t know if they took this decision following to the group
 participation or if they decided this and then joined the group for more information. The fact is that their attitude is aligned with the
  purpose of the group. And 17,1% are not making use of any kind of contraceptive at the moment, which can be surprising if they are not
   trying to get pregnant, but also makes sense to the choice of not taking hormonal contraceptives.

<p class="content" style="padding-top:0%">
We asked them about possible unpleasant side-effects related to the use of hormonal contraceptives to understand precisely if this occurrence
 could be related to the interest for the group. 69% experienced a decrease of libido when taking hormones. The other three most frequent
  side-effects were decrease of vaginal lubrication (56%), fluid retention (52,4%) and strong headaches (47,4%). In the open option, we
   detected frequent answers mentioning depression, mood swings, anxiety, altered blood pressure and fatigue, for example.

<p class="content" style="padding-top:0%">
When they made remarks considering the side-effects more related to psychological occurrences (depression, mood swings and anxiety) they many
 times made reference to how bad they were, using adjectives that weren’t present when they mentioned other symptoms – “A LOT of anxiety”,
  “disproportional emotional sensibility”, “exaggerated increase of anxiety”, “significative mood alterations”, “absurd mood swings”,
   “drastic mood alterations”, and so on. It does not seem that they were just merely qualifying these effects. What it looks like is that
    when it comes to unpleasant feelings related to women’s psychological side they need to add adjectives to express how serious they are
     to be taken in consideration. This becomes even more notorious when we are talking about the pill’s or hormonal contraceptive’s
      side-effects. People and the medical community tend to think that women in general are emotionally instable and have intrinsically
       mood swings, for example, as part of their existence. Therefore, they need to stress, highlight and use superlatives to describe
        feelings of their own body and mind to maybe have the chance to be taken seriously in these matters.
