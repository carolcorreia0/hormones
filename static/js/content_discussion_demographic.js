    It was possible to draw a profile of the participants of the group “Goodbye Hormones” from some questions during the surveys
     and the video interview. The vast majority is in the age group of 18 to 30 years old (85,1%). That is probably linked to the 
     fact individuals of this age group are more comfortable with technology and social media and it is usually during these years 
     that the woman is more sexually active. 74,9% of the women have at least a Bachelor’s or Master’s Degree, which represents that 
     they are well educated analysis corpus. The huge majority (98,1%) considers themselves as heterosexual or bisexual, which is 
     totally understandable considering that the main reason for them to join the group is to search for alternatives for contraception.

     Only 10,8% have kids; other 88% don’t.
