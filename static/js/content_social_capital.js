<p class="title"> Social Capital </p>
<p class="content">
The concept of social capital plays an important role in this research. We consider it to be a central element in the exchanges, 
collaborations and actions in social networks. We have as hypothesis that the reason why people want and need to collaborate in 
social media is to collect, obtain and, above all, to accumulate this kind of capital, that can be converted into various other 
attributes – tangible or not – like prestige, popularity or money for example.

Pierre Bourdieu is known for being the first to bring up the concept with “Le capital social: notes provisoires” in 1980. He so defines:</p> 

<blockquote> <div style="border: 0px solid #FFF; padding:10px; background-color:rgba(89, 17, 49,0.5);">Social capital is the totality of current or potential resources that are linked to the possession of a sustainable network of more or less 
institutionalized relationships of intercognition; Or, in other words, belonging to a group, as a set of agents that are not only 
endowed with common properties (that can be perceived by the observer, by others, or by themselves) but are also united by permanent 
and useful connections. <cite>BOURDIEU, 1980 : 1</cite> </div>  
</blockquote>

    The “volume” of social capital depends on the size of the connections an agent is capable of effectively mobilize, and on the economic, cultural, social or symbolic capital that each of those connections has. Bourdieu’s definition explores four other linked concepts: 
</p>
    <p class="content" style="padding-left:10%; padding-top:0%;line-height: 140%;">
    a) Resources – the supplies or sources of aid that are or might be available in an individual’s social network.
    </br>
    b) Social network – a stable and “durable” social network (or networks) that allows individuals to access resources.
    </br>
    c) Relationships – interactions based on subjective (e.g. feelings, such as friendship, respect, etc.) or institutional 
    (e.g. the name of a family) acquaintance and recognition. It is through acquaintance and recognition that social capital 
    gains a symbolic character that allows it to be acknowledged and legitimized.
    </br>
    d) Group membership – the association with a group that provides durable and helpful social connections.
