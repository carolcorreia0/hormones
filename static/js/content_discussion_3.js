Although the group does not define itself as feminist and even if we cannot find many posts discussing specifically feminism
 (there are only 10 of them marked with “feminism” as hashtag), we do believe that yes, it is feminist due to its content strongly attached
  to the empowerment of women through the awareness of their body. 
</p>

<p class="content" style="padding-top:0%">
During our interview with the founder of the group, she explained that she didn’t intend to use the “F word” (for feminism)
 because of the weight it carries, but that the group has some guiding principles that are strictly linked to feminism like sorority,
  empathy, companionship and self- knowledge. Another interviewed participant also mentioned that the word can be a burden that “can
   create a lot of discussion nowadays, but I think it is feminist because it brings empowerment of the woman over her body and that is an
    issue completely feminist”. 
    </p>
<p class="content" style="padding-top:0%">
So as results we had 77% of women that consider themselves as feminists and 64,4% that consider that the group is feminist.
 As we were aware that the word could represent an auto- definition problem we left the option “maybe” available, which had
  quite an expressive number over the “no” option; 12,5% for the first question and 22,6% for the second one.
