We intended to verify the occurrence of bonding and bridging capitals. As we explained, Putnam (2000) makes the distinction of these 
two types of capital. The first is related to homogeneous and closer groups with close relationships, such as fraternal groups; this 
kind of relationship can possibly include, besides emotional support, varied benefits (such as willingness to loan a sum of money, for example).

The other would be related to more diverse and heterogeneous groups, composed by “weak ties”, loose connections between the individuals. 
In this case, the benefits would derive from these casual acquaintances and connections.

<p class="content" style="padding-top:0%">
Facebook, as a social network, has as general function to form and maintain a wide network of social connections. 
Although some literature suggests that it is used more for communication among acquaintances and offline contacts than it is for 
connecting with strangers, in the case of groups like the one we are analyzing things work differently. In a group of almost 130.000 users, 
even if you were invited by a friend, that crowd is definitely not your friend, even if you are completely in favor of ideas like sorority 
and female companionship. So, in this case, we would be facing the bridging social capital form.

We asked them if they had already made friends from the group. To which only 9,7% said “Yes”. When it came to strengthen friendships 
they already had from the group, 35,2% answered “Yes”. In the video interviews, some said that the topics that they discuss in the group 
are also a subject of conversation between them, a sort of element to push the friendship on.
