<p class="title"> Goodbye Hormones </p>
<p class="content">
The revolution for women's rights began on March 8, 1857, when American workers protested for better working conditions
 and gave rise to the International Women's Day. But it was not until May 1960 that they became autonomous to choose the 
 time to get pregnant and to expand their entry into the labor market at the time, with the sale and distribution of the 
 first contraceptive pill, Enovid, a drug with a high-level concentration of hormones. The novelty was a watershed in terms 
 of sexual liberation and gave women an alternative to expectation of motherhood and domestic life; they finally were able 
 to rule the family planning, without having to abdicate other aspects and wishes of their lives. 
</br></br>

More than half a century and many questions later, they return to preach the revolution through another choice: stop taking 
the pill to regain control of their own bodies without synthetic intermediates. Some believe that taking hormones and considering 
the side-effects that they come with like depression, mood swings or PMS, make the woman a lesser version of herself, it 
artificially alters her identity. In the other hand, fertility and body awareness, to know how their bodies work, brings independence 
and empowerment. 
</br></br>

Women began to question the mainstream acceptance of hormonal contraceptives and to ask themselves: 
<span style="background-color:rgba(89, 17, 49,0.5); font-size:1.1vw; font-weight:500;">“Is it fair to compromise my health in order 
to be the responsible one for the birth control?”. </span>
</br></br>

The matter regarding the hormonal contraception is more complex and touches more several issues than one can imagine at first sight. 
It comprises subjects since the hegemony of the pharmaceutic industry, passing by the asymmetry in power relations between women and 
men, and the empowerment of women from the control of their bodies and fertility. It’s about making available all the information 
concerning this matter in order for the woman to choose and decide what suits her better, with total liberty to choose even the 
hormonal option if she so wants to.
