<p class="title"> Discussion </p>
<p class="content">
First of all, the huge majority (70%) thinks that the group is a safe and free place to share experiences and opinions, so problems
 of nature that could intimidate or constrain users are practically excluded. They also mostly agree that the kind of information and 
 discussion that is in the group is hard to find somewhere else, so it gives another status, one of the rareness and singularity to 
 the content. The level of participation in the discussions, whether making posts or comments, is quite varied; the majority (38%) 
 answered “2” in a scale from “0” to “4” how often they take part in the group. The other parts of the percentage were more or less 
 distributed in the other scales (from “never” to “always”). 
 </p>
<p class="content" style="padding-top:0%">
Regarding their motivations to intervene (to comment or make posts), except for those who just observe (11,3%), 
the most incident reasons were: Related to themselves: “when I have doubts”, “to be helped”, “to obtain information”, 
“to share my feelings”, “to share experiences”, “to enlarge my vision about things”, “to learn” or “to gain knowledge”. 
Related to the other: “give advices”, “to help”, “to offer help”, “to spread some knowledge”, “to answer questions”, “to encourage the girls”,
 “to show solidarity”, “to correct some information”. Neutral (not centrally related to oneself nor the other): “to exchange experiences”,
  “to learn”, “curiosity”, “empathy”, “support”, “collaboration”, “feeling of identification”, “to interact”, “to demonstrate sorority”. 
  </p>

<p class="content" style="padding-top:0%">
Right away we can find some expressions that in this context belong particularly to the feminist universe, like “empathy”, “collaboration”,
 “solidarity” and “sorority”. Besides that, we realized that when they interacted focusing “on the other”, some notions of being able to do
  a determined action are implied. For example, in order to give advices or to offer help, the person need to at least feel that she is able
   to provide what she is proposing. She needs to possess something that turns her able to present herself in that situation. Another clearer
    example is the reason to collaborate “to correct some information”. If the woman thinks that her objective there is to correct someone,
     it is implied that she thinks that she has the means (in that case, some specific knowledge about something) to do so. 
     And those attributes that maybe unconsciously they consider to have, are nothing more than social capital; those individual skills,
     competencies, and know-how are implied in these mentioned intentions. 
     </p>

<p class="content" style="padding-top:0%">
We also found some clues about this and other things they may consider relevant in order to participate in some unique answers.
 One user said “I only intervene when I think that my contributions would be essential and unpublished so far”. This person appears to 
 have a clear idea of what it would turn a contribution owner of social capital, that is, when it has the characteristics of essentiality 
 and originality (the judgement of what would be consider essential and original is up to the user to decide, what matters is that she has
  this intention in view). 
  </p>
<p class="content" style="padding-top:0%">
Some others said “when I feel able to help”, “when I have a relevant opinion”, “when I have something new to add”,
 “when I have some knowledge about a question made”. All these characteristics about what they have or what the content
  that she plans to share has are social capital forms. One person even said “I have a Bachelor in Biology and I try
   to inform women about their own body”. That means that when she thinks about participating, she has in mind that once she
    has the scientific capital that her Bachelor in Biology provided to her, not only she is able to inform a group of women
     about their body, but it is more likely to be accepted for, maybe, accumulate some more social capital.
