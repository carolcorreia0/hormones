That brings us to the forms of measuring acceptance/social capital in this group. We made use of the like and the interactions generated
 from an intervention as a tool to measure social capital. The causality relation is simple, the more likes one get, the more powerful the
  person or the message is. So first we asked if, when expressing themselves in the group, they felt more comfortable and confident when 
  the other users like their publication. We gave the possibility to answer from “not at all” (0) to “yes, a lot” (4). We could see that 
  this approval really matters to the users; more than 50% answered numbers “3” and “4” in the scale.

Once again, due to the feminist ideas of the participants and the feminist vibe that is present in the group, we got several answers regarding
 the representation of the like that made reference to: the fact that it shows empathy, empowerment, indicator of reciprocity, sorority,
  solidarity and companionship. One of our interviewees said: “I think that gives strength. It’s important. We often hear that we’re crazy, 
  so the like means that is not only me that feel this way, and we strengthen together”. Others said: “The like means ‘we’re together!’” or 
  “To encourage the sister”.

<p class="content" style="padding-top:0%">
The idea that they have regarding receiving the demonstration of a like is related to the approval by the others and that would signify that
 their post has attributes that makes it “pertinent”, “relevant”, “validated”, “not idiot”, “legitimate”, “useful”, “interesting”, 
 “credible”, “funny” – to use the words that they mentioned significant times to describe it. Once more, the social capital appears to indicate
 the value of something and stablish power relations between the interactions. Some users considered that this element of approval could be 
 understood as a stimulus to continue the discussion. In that case, we can say that the individual that chooses to continue to interact and 
 discuss would have a different status than before, than the previous one when he began to talk.

<p class="content" style="padding-top:0%">
Regarding the feelings that it causes, they appear to be more related to identification and support. “I feel understood”, “It means that 
I’m closer to be right about something”, “It brings security”, “It means that I’m not alone”, “It feeds my ego. That's the truth”. All 
positive feelings that could lead to an encouragement and confidence to continue with more strength. 
</p>
<p class="content" style="padding-top:0%">
We detected as well the idea that receiving likes or commentaries would be a tool to turn the post more visible (and feed this cycle again). 
We know that Facebook adjusts its algorithms as result of these kind of elements, but in the case of a Facebook group it is highly important 
because the posts are organized in a vertical form, from the most recent to the older one. A new comment makes the post goes up again, 
increasing the chances for it to become visible and popular. When we made an open question in the other sense, concerning what would be the 
reasons for one to like someone else’s post, some said specifically “to help to give some visibility to the post” or “to give an ‘up!’, to 
make to post go up in the page”. They are aware of the operational elements involved in the structure of the page and use the like as a 
mechanism to work according to their intentions.

Lastly, one of our questions was “Have you ever deleted a post due to lack of "likes" or interactions?”. Only 9,8% (110 people) answered yes.
 But considering that it is an extreme reaction to delete a post only because of this reason, that number is quite surprising. It represents
  the direct relation to the intention to receive this symbolic approval, a more evident way to measure the ownership of social capital.
